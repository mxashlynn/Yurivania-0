# Yurivania 0: Soul Night Prelude 🌱🐍

Monstergirls work together to help out some lost ghosts~!

This is my entry to [Trans Game Dev Birthday Jam](https://itch.io/jam/tgd-jam), a short Yurivania side-story and prequel.

The Midnight Palace is hosting a major ritual to assist spirits navigating the realms beyond mortality.
Tibby is planning on attending and really wants her friend Stheno to come along.
To get there on time, they will have to work together to overcome some unexpected obstacles, maybe making a new friend along the way!

# Goals 👭👻

- People really liked Yurivania so I wanted to make a followup that was just as cute, simple, and gay as the original.
- I love GB Studio and wanted to keep using it.
- I wanted to keep the scope *really, really* small so that I could finish it in about two weeks.
