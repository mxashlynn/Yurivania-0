# YURIVANIA 0

## Concept

- The Midnight Palace is hosting a major ritual to open a gate to help ghosts more easily navigate the realms beyond mortality.
- Tibby is planning on attending and really wants her friend Stheno to come along!
- To get there on time, they have to ---






- Gameplay and building are going to be along the lines of story mode in Mario Maker 2.
- Mechanics and setting will be inspired by Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest and Castlevania: Order of Ecclasia.
    - But with much less technical platforming and probably no combat.

## Story Beats

- The Midnight Palace is hosting a major ritual to open a gate to help ghosts more easily navigate the realms beyond mortality.
- Tibby is planning on attending and really wants her friend Stheno to come along!
- Stheno is running late and feeling nervous to be meeting so many folks for the first time!
- Tibby reassures her that everything will be fine~~

- Tibby and Stheno meet up at the base of a cliffside (within the castle grounds?  Right outside the castle?)
- On the way up the mountain they meet up with Alraune who is helping sheppherd ghosts in the right direction.
    - Stheno is crushing hard on Alraune and wants to help out, in order to impress her!
    - Tibby agrees after some hesitation because she really wants to give back to the community.
- Tibby, Stheno, and Alraune work together to gather some lost ghosts.
